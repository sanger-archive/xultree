Xultree is a Mozilla XUL application for browsing JSON data retrieved from a
URL. 

It is useful for debugging web services that expose JSON data or for
exploring JSON data structures that need to be consumed as part of web or other
software interface.

It is also my first implementation of the mozilla nsITreeView for hierarchical
tree displays. Be kind ;-)
